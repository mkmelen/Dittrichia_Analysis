Tab,Colmun Name,Definition
Vegetation Survey,,
,Flag,"Combination of the block (letter) and treatment (number) making a Plot ID (e.g., A1, A2, A3, A4, A5… B1, etc.)"
,Bare,Presence of bare ground at the point sampled
,Grass,Presence of grass at the point sampled
,Forb,Presence of forb at the point sampled
,HECO,Presence of Hemizonia congesta subsp. luzulifolia at the point sampled
,Trt,"There are 5 Treatments: Control (background grassland), Biomass Removal (above and belowground biomass was removed), Raking + Clipping (thatch was removed and then mowed in spring to 5 cm), Raking (thatch was removed), +Hemizonia (Hemizonia congesta subsp. luzulifolia seed was added to background grassland)."
,,
Phenology Survey,,
,Block,"Treatments are in a Blocked design, with 5 treatments in each Block, 10 Blocks total (A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J)."
,Plot,"Treatments are applied to each Plot. There are 5 Plots in each Block (1,2,3,4,5), 10 Plots of each Treatment."
,Flag,Each Plot has a Flag in the southwestern corner denoting the Block letter and Plot replicate.
,Pos,Pos = Position of the plant. Each Plot was planted from the south to north and from west to east. There are 16 plant positions in a 4x4 grid.
,PlantID,"Each plant has an ID which denotes to Block, Plot, and plant position. Ex: A1_01 = Block A, Plot 1, plant position 01 (upper left corner)"
,Population,"Each plant orginates from a particular source population where its seed was collected in Santa Clara County, and was either from a roadside (R) or off-road (O) location."
,Site,The source population for the plant where its seed was collected in Santa Clara County.
,Habitat,Whether the seed was collected from a roadside (R) or off-road (O) location.
,Treatment,"There are 5 Treatments: Control (background grassland), Biomass Removal (above and belowground biomass was removed), Raking + Clipping (thatch was removed and then mowed in spring to 5 cm), Raking (thatch was removed), +Hemizonia (Hemizonia congesta subsp. luzulifolia seed was added to background grassland)."
,PlantDate,Date for when plants were transplanted from the UCSC greenhouse to Blue Oak Ranch Reserve. Each plant was censused weekly and replaced for the first month if it died.
,LeafMeas1,Measurement of the length of the longest leaf (mm) at transplantation date.
,LeafMeas2,Measurement of the length of the longest leaf (mm) during May.
,MortDate,Date when a plant was deemed dead
,DeathBy,"In some rare cases, the death of a plant was linked to a species interaction, such as squirrel activity."
,MortBinary,Mortality dates transformed into 0 and alive plants awarded a 1.
,Censor,MortBinary duplicate but made continuous in JMP to perform survival analysis.
,DaysMortCont,"Continuous data format for JMP. For plants that died, this is the number of days that the plant was alive before dying."
,DaysMortNom,"Nominal data format for JMP. For plants that died, this is the number of days that the plant was alive before dying."
,Census,This is the latest phenology survey date which is used for producing DaysCensus which is the number of days that an alive plant has been alive for.
,DaysCensus,The number of days an alive plant has been alive for (or number of days the experiment has been ongoing for that plant).
,NumDaysAlive,This is a summary of DaysMort for dead plants and DaysCensus for alive plants.
,HarvDate,"The date when the plant was harvested. This is based on when buds were found, however this decision didn't go into effect until July 2, 2021."
,BudDate,"The date when buds were first identified on the plant starting on July 2, 2021."
,Repro,"A binary code for stating whether the plant reproduced. 0 = failure, 1 = reproduction."
,DaysBud,The number of days it took a plant to form buds.
,NumBuds,An ongoing tally of the number of buds being found on the plant. Only used until we decided to harvest when buds first found.
,FlowerDate,This is the date for which flowers where first identified (and removed) on the plant. Sometimes the weekly survey did not catch buds in time to remove them before petals showed color. Only used until we decided to harvest when buds first found.
,NumFlower,An ongoing tally of the number of flowers being found on the plant. Only used until we decided to harvest when buds first found.
,Height,The height (cm) of the plant from the crown (root/stem boundary) to the tallest leading leaf.
,Biomass,The dry aboveground biomass (g) of the plant.
,BiomassDate,The date the aboveground biomass was weighed.
,Notes,Field notes.
